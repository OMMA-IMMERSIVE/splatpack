.TH SPLATPACK 1 "January 2026" "splatpack 0.1.0" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
splatpack \- export photogrammetry ready JPGs from DNG sequences using darktable-cli, then bundle results
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B splatpack
.RI [ path ]
.RI [ options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B splatpack
recursively scans a dataset directory for Digital Negative (DNG) files, exports them to JPEG images
using
.B darktable-cli
and writes a clean "job" bundle under an output directory.

This is designed for workflows where you capture CinemaDNG or other DNG sequences in the field,
convert them to solver friendly images, then ship the results to a compute box for alignment,
COLMAP export, Gaussian splatting training, or similar pipelines.

By default, splatpack:
.IP \(bu 2
searches for .dng files under the target directory (recursive)
.IP \(bu 2
groups DNGs by their parent folder (each folder is treated as a sequence)
.IP \(bu 2
exports JPEGs into a timestamped job folder
.IP \(bu 2
writes job.json metadata and manifest.txt (list of exported images)
.IP \(bu 2
optionally creates a ZIP file for transport

.SH QUICK START
Run in the dataset folder:
.PP
.nf
splatpack
.fi
.PP
Make a ZIP bundle for transfer:
.PP
.nf
splatpack --zip
.fi
.PP
Apply a darktable style:
.PP
.nf
splatpack --style "splat_neutral" --zip
.fi

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I path
Dataset directory to process. If omitted, defaults to the current directory.
.TP
.BR --out " " OUTDIR
Name of the output folder created inside the dataset directory.
Default is
.BR _splatpack .
.TP
.BR --style " " NAME
Optional darktable style name to apply during export.
If provided, splatpack passes
.B --style NAME
to
.BR darktable-cli .
.TP
.BR --quality " " N
JPEG quality from 1 to 100. Default is 95.
.TP
.BR --max-long-edge " " N
Optional max long edge in pixels. This is applied as a best effort configuration hint to darktable.
For maximum reliability, include resizing in the darktable style instead.
.TP
.BR --zip
Create a ZIP archive of the job folder.
.TP
.BR --job-name " " NAME
Override the default job name (derived from dataset folder name).
.TP
.BR --dry-run
Print actions without exporting or writing files.

.SH OUTPUTS
splatpack creates a timestamped job directory under:
.PP
.nf
<dataset>/<out>/<job_name>_<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS>/
.fi
.PP
Inside the job directory:
.TP
.B images/
Exported JPEG images.
.TP
.B manifest.txt
Absolute or relative paths to exported images (one per line).
.TP
.B job.json
Metadata about this run (counts, settings, timestamps, paths).

If
.B --zip
is used, a ZIP file is crea
